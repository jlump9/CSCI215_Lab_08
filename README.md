## NOTES: ##
## jQuery Effects ##
Making elements on a web page appear and disappear is a common JavaScript task such as drop-down navigation menus, pop-up tooltips, and automated slideshows. jQuery supplies a few functions to make this easier.

*$('.submenu').hide()* would hide all of the tags with a class of submenu. 

Each effect function also can take in an optional speed and a *callback* function.
  * speed represents the amount of time the effect takes to complete
    * can be *fast, normal, slow* or a number of milliseconds 
    * $('element').fadeOut('slow');
  * callback is a function that runs when the effect is finished
  
  ### Basic Showing and Handling ###
  jQuery provides three functions for basic hiding and showing of elements:
  * _show()_ - makes a hidden element visible
  * _hide()_ - hides a visible element
  * _toggle()_ - switches the current display value
    
  ### Fading Elements In and Out ###
  For more dramatic effect, you can fade elements in or out
  * _fadeIn()_ - makes hidden element fade into view
  * _fadeOut()_ - hides a visible element by making it fade out of view
  * _fadeToggle()_ - combines both fadeIn() and fadeOut()
  * _fadeTo()_ - fades and image to a specific opacity. Must provide a speed value
    * _$('p').fadeTo('normal', .75);_ - fades at normal speed to .75 opacity
